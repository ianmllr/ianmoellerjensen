                        by comparing discounts that phone plan providers offer to new customers. In order to attract customers,
                        providers will offer discounts on new tech in exchange for you agreeing to be a customer with them for
                        6 months. Providers hope you will forget that and stay with them forever, but really, everyone
                        should switch every 6 months for their own benefit. Collecting all these discounts and offers and
                        comparing them to each other and to actual market prices provides a genuine view of when there
                        is money to be saved, and that is what Tech-tilbud helps users with."
